The clickable kit -- not just markdown -- is the deliverable. Skip only if the user says they don't want it.",

It distills the ramble into a Product Brief + a COMPLETE, MANDATORY Research Plan across ALL 10 desks (product, customer, competitive, market, pricing, channels, analyst/KOL, EVENTS, REVIEWS, GTM/launch) -- scope each with named entities, skip NONE (events is always in: which events, never whether). Then run them via `pmm-research-desk`. An impeccable launch needs the full sweep; do not jump to strategy before the brief + the research land in the evidence ledger.",

For VoC, competitive, or any 'what are people saying' task, run BOTH and synthesize -- two independent source pools beats one. They are separate skills by design; do not merge them.",
